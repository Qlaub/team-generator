# Team Generator

## Description
Generate a styled HTML page with information about all of your team members! This application uses inquirer.js to prompt the user with questions regarding the members of a project team. The answers to the questions are then used to create an HTML page with informational cards for each team member.

## Installation
Download the project folder from GitHub, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal, and then run 'npm install' in the terminal.

## Usage
Once you have run 'npm install', navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal (if you aren't there already), and run 'node index' in the terminal to start the application. You will be prompted with questions in the terminal, starting with questions about your team manager. Although there can only be one manager per team, you can add as many engineers and interns to your team as you need. When you are finished, select 'Finish building my team' and hit enter. An index.html file will be created in the dist directory complete with all of the information you provided. If you move this index.html file to another location, be sure to move the entire dist folder and not only the index.html file. Without the assets folder at the proper location, the index.html page won't be styled.

## Tests
To test this application, first make sure you have run 'npm install' in your terminal at the root directory of the project. Then run 'npm test' in your terminal at the root directory of the project. Test files can be found in the __tests__ directory.
